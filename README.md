# OpenAIChat
This is an example of Azure OpenAI usage for creating a chat. This includes leveraging the azure resource, creating the necessary service and prompt engineering.

To test and use, insert the endpoint, api key and deployment (Constants file) from your azure OpenAI resouce, and start playing! In Prod these parameters should be taken from the resource (or other related resources) directly in a secure manner (as Env variables for example).

You should also play with the model instructions, prompt engineering is an art - many different scenarios can be achieved by changing the "system" requirements.
